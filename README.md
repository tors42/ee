# ee

An External Engine provider for Lichess Analysis

## Download

Pre-built archives can be found at [releases](https://github.com/tors42/ee/releases)  
If you don't have a chess engine on your computer, you can download an archive with
the suffix `-embed.zip`. They are slightly bigger and contain the Stockfish engine.  
If you already have a chess engine on your computer, you can download the
archive without the `-embed.zip` suffix, and configure the application to use
your existing binary.

The archive contains a directory `ee-0.0.1` which you can unpack on your computer.

To start the application, run the `ee` or `ee.bat` file in the `ee-0.0.1/bin` directory.

2. Optionally click the `Configure...` button in the `Engine` tab to update engine settings.  

3. Open web page [Lichess Analysis](https://lichess.org/analysis) and click the hamburger menu in the lower right, to find the `Engine Manager` selection and change from `Lichess` to `External Engine`. _Hint, you can change the name `External Engine` to something more personal in the application in the `Engine` tab_
